== Gelatinization

<<figureC-1>> gives an example of a typical gelatinization curve. <<figureC-2>>
shows the three stages of gelatinization.

.Typical gelatinization curve

footnote:[The time stem:[t_90] was estimated to be 18,2 min for this example.]

[%key]
stem:[w]:: mass fraction of gelatinized kernels, expressed in per cent
stem:[t]:: cooking time, expressed in minutes
stem:[t_90]:: time required to gelatinize 90 % of the kernels
P:: point of the curve corresponding to a cooking time of stem:[t_90]

NOTE: These results are based on a study carried out on three different types of
kernel.

.Stages of gelatinization
====
.Initial stages: No grains are fully gelatinized (ungelatinized starch granules are visible inside the kernels)

.Intermediate stages: Some fully gelatinized kernels are visible

.Final stages: All kernels are fully gelatinized
