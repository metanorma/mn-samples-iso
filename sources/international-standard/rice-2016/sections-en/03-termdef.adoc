=== extraneous matter
alt:[EM]
domain:[rice]

[example]
Foreign seeds, husks, bran, sand, dust.

NOTE: This category includes whole or broken kernels that are yellow due to
alteration. Parboiled rice in a batch of non-parboiled rice is also included in

[.source]
<<ISO14864,clause 3.2>>

=== gelatinization time
stem:[t_90]

term:[gel state]
