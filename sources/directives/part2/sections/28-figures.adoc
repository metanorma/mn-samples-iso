== Figures

[[scls_28-1]]
=== Purpose or rationale

Figures are a graphical means of representation used when they are the most efficient means of presenting information in an easily comprehensible form.

Photographs and other media may be used if it is not possible to represent the concept as a line drawing.


[[scls_28-2]]
=== Title

It is recommended to provide a concise figure title.


[[scls_28-3]]
=== Numbering and subdivision

[[scls_28-3-1]]
==== Figure designation

Figures shall be designated "`Figure`" and numbered with Arabic numerals, beginning with 1. A single figure shall be designated "`Figure 1`". This numbering shall be independent of the numbering of the clauses and of any tables.

In annexes, the figure numbering restarts and the number is preceded by the annex letter (e.g. Figure A.1, etc.).

When a figure is continued over several pages, it can be useful to repeat the figure designation, followed by the title (optional) and by "`(1 of #)`", where # is the total number of pages on which the figure appears.

*Figure* x (1 of #)

[[scls_28-3-2]]
==== Subfigures

In general, the use of subfigures should be avoided whenever possible since it complicates document layout and management.

Only one level of subdivision of a figure is permitted. Subfigures shall be identified by a lower case letter [e.g. Figure 1 may comprise subfigures a), b), c), ...]. Other forms of identification of the subfigures such as 1.1, 1.2, ..., 1-1, 1-2, ..., etc. shall not be used.

Separate keys, notes and footnotes for subfigures are not permitted.

Footnotes to the figure

[[scls_28-4]]
=== Referencing

Each figure shall be explicitly referred to within the text.

Use, for example, the following forms for references to figures and subfigures:

* "`Figure 3 illustrates…`";
* "`See Figure 6 b)`".

[[scls_28-5-2]]
==== Choice of letter symbols, style of lettering

Letter symbols used in figures to represent general cases of angular or linear quantities shall be in accordance with ISO 80000-3. Subscripts can be used where necessary to distinguish between different applications of a given symbol.

Various lengths, stem:[l], on a drawing should be written with descriptor indices, e.g. stem:[l_1], stem:[l_2], stem:[l_3], and not, for instance, stem:[A], stem:[B], stem:[C], etc. or stem:[a], stem:[b], stem:[c], etc. The main symbols used in drawings from ISO 80000-3 are given in <<table_10>>.

[[table_10]]
.Main symbols used in drawings from ISO 80000-3
[cols="2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Symbols

| Length | stem:[l], stem:[L]
| Breadth | stem:[b], stem:[B]
| Height | stem:[h], stem:[H]
| Thickness | stem:[d], stem:[delta]
| Radius | stem:[r], stem:[R]
| Radial distance | stem:[r_Q], stem:[rho]
| Diameter | stem:[d], stem:[D]
| Length of path | stem:[s]
| Distance | stem:[d], stem:[r]
| Cartesian coordinates | stem:[x, y, z]
| Position vector | stem:[bb(r)]
| Displacement | stem:[bb(Delta r)]
| Radius of curvature | stem:[rho]
|===


Lettering on technical product documentation shall be in accordance with the ISO 3098 series. Italic letters shall be used for variable quantities.

The vertical (upright) style shall be used for all other lettering.

When all units for a quantity are the same, a suitable statement (e.g. "`Dimensions in millimetres`") shall be placed above the right-hand corner of the figure.

See <<figure_5>>.

*Key*

1:: mandrel shank
2:: blind rivet head

The mandrel shall be designed such that the blind rivet end deforms during installation, and the shank can expand.

NOTE: Figure # illustrates a type A rivet head.

^a^ The break area shall be milled.

^b^ The mandrel head is commonly chromium plated.

[[scls_28-5-3]]
==== Key and labels to figures

Figures shall be language neutral in order to facilitate translation, using key references or figure footnotes (see <<figure_5>>) instead of textual descriptions (in accordance with ISO 6433).

In graphs (see <<figure_6>>), labelling of curves, lines, etc. shall be replaced by key references. Labelling on the axes shall not be replaced by numerical key references, which could be confused with numeric values.


[[figure_6]]
.Example of a graph
====
[[figure_6a]]

*Key*

stem:[w]:: mass fraction of gelatinized kernels, expressed in per cent
	
stem:[t]:: cooking time, expressed in minutes

stem:[t_{90}]:: time required to gelatinize stem:[90 %] of the kernels

P:: point of the curve corresponding to a cooking time of stem:[t_{90}]

NOTE: These results are based on a study carried out on three different types of kernel.

^a^ The time stem:[t_{90}] was estimated to be 18,2 min for this example.
====


In flowcharts and organigrams, the use of textual descriptions is permitted (see <<scls_28-6-4>>).


[[scls_28-5-4]]
==== Notes to figures

A single note in a figure shall be preceded by "`NOTE`", placed at the beginning of the first line of the text of the note. See <<figure_5>>. When several notes occur in the same figure, they shall be designated "`NOTE 1`", "`NOTE 2`", "`NOTE 3`", etc. The numbering restarts for each new figure.

Notes to figures shall not contain requirements or any information considered indispensable for the use of the document. Any requirements relating to the content of a figure shall be given in the text, in a footnote to the figure or as a paragraph between the figure and its title. Notes to figures do not need to be referred to.

<<table_8>> summarizes how to use notes and footnotes within documents.


[[scls_28-5-5]]
==== Footnotes to figures

Footnotes to figures are numbered independently from footnotes to the text.

Footnotes to figures shall be distinguished by superscript lower case letters, starting with "`a`". The footnotes shall be referred to in the figure by inserting the same superscript lower case letter. See <<figure_5>>.

Footnotes to figures may contain requirements.

<<table_8>> summarizes how to use notes and footnotes within documents.

==== Mechanical engineering drawings

Mechanical engineering drawings shall be prepared in accordance with relevant ISO standards (listed in <<scls_28-5-1>>). Different views, details and sections of a component or multicomponent object shall be presented in conformity with ISO 128-30, ISO 128-34, ISO 128-40 and ISO 128-44. Different views, details and sections of a component or multicomponent object shall not be presented as subfigures.

See <<figure_7>>.

==== Graphical symbols

Graphical symbols for use on equipment shall be in accordance with IEC 60417 and ISO 7000. Public information symbols shall be in accordance with ISO 7001. Safety signs shall be in accordance with ISO 7010.

For purposes of consistency and coherence, IEC TC 3, IEC SC 3C and ISO/TC 145 are responsible for the standardization of graphical symbols and safety signs. If an adequate symbol or safety sign does not exist in the IEC and ISO databases, contact IEC TC 3, IEC SC 3C and ISO/TC 145 in order to register a standardized symbol.
