= High level structure, identical core text, common terms and core definitions

== Introduction

.DRAFTING INSTRUCTION
====
Specific to the discipline.

This text has been prepared using the "high-level structure" (i.e. clause sequence, identical core text and common terms and core definitions) provided in Annex SL, Appendix 2 of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. This is intended to enhance alignment among ISO and IEC management system standards, and to facilitate their implementation for organizations that need to meet the requirements of two or more such standards.

HLS is highlighted in the text (clauses 1 to 10) by the use of blue font. Black represents the ISO or IEC specific discipline text. Strikeout is used to show agreed deletions within the HLS text. The use of blue text and strikeout is only to facilitate analysis and will not be incorporated after the Draft International Standard stage of development for this document.

== Terms and definitions

.DRAFTING INSTRUCTION 1
====
Clause Title shall be used. Terms and definitions may either be within the standard or in a separate document.

Common terms and core definitions shall be stated as well as others that are discipline specific.

The arrangement of terms and definitions should preferably be listed according to the hierarchy of the concepts (i.e. systematic order). Alphabetical order is the least preferred order.

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.
====

.DRAFTING INSTRUCTION 2
====
The following terms and definitions constitute an integral part of the "common text" for management systems standards. Additional terms and definitions may be added as needed. Notes may be added or modified to serve the purpose of each standard.
====

.DRAFTING INSTRUCTION 3
====
Italics type in a definition indicates a cross-reference to another term defined in this clause, and the number reference for the term is given in parentheses.
====

.DRAFTING INSTRUCTION 4
====
Where the text "XXX" appears throughout this clause, the appropriate reference should be inserted depending on the context in which these terms and definitions are being applied. For example: "an XXX objective" could be substituted as "an information security objective".
