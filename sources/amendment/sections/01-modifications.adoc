Containers of rice should be stored in covered premises, well protected from the sun, rain and excessive heat.

The storeroom should be dry, free from unpleasant odours and protected against entry of insects and other vermin. Ventilation should be adjusted in such a way as to give good ventilation during dry weather and to be fully closed under damp conditions. Suitable provisions should be made for fumigation of storerooms.

Containers should be handled and transported in such a way that they are protected from the rain, sun or other sources of excessive heat, unpleasant odours and any other contamination (especially in the holds of ships).
