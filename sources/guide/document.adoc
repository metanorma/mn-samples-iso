Comment 1: DOCUMENT NUMBER (:docnumber:)

Sequence of digits that gives the document number value included in the document identifier, for example:

99999 (to author ISO-99999)
8000 (to author ISO-8000),
22745 (to author ISO-22745),
29002 (to author ISO-29002)
////

////
Comment 2: DOCUMENT TITLE (mandatory)

The document title in Metanorma may be composed by three attributes from which two are optional and one mandatory. These attributtes are used instead of the metanorma-standoc `:title:` attribute and the default AsciiDoc title (the first line of the document header, prefixed with `=`):

`:title-intro-en:` The introductory component of the English title (optional)
`:title-main-en:` The main component of the English title (mandatory)
`:title-part-en:` The English title of the document part (optional)
`:title-intro-fr:` The introductory component of the French title (optional)
`:title-main-fr:` The main component of the French title (mandatory)
`:title-part-fr:` The French title of the document part (optional)

Both the English and the French titles for the document are required, for both the English and the French version of the document. The main title will be that of the language the document is in.
////

////
Comment 3: DOCUMENT TYPE (:doctype:) (mandatory)

Its possible values are defined by ISO deliverables: https://www.iso.org/deliverables-all.html

The permitted types are:
international-standard,
technical-specification,
technical-report,
publicly-available-specification,
international-workshop-agreement,
guide.
////

Comment 4:  DOCUMENT STAGE (:docstage:) (Synonym of :status:)

Stage code for the document status. See International harmonized stage codes: https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html

ISO authors usually create Metanorma documents at stages 00 through 40 (PWI, NWIP, WD, CD, DIS). Documents at the final stages, 50 and 60 (FDIS, PRF, IS), are created by ISO Editorial Program Managers at ISO/CS (aka ISO EPMs, ISO Editors). Authors using Metanorma are not expected to edit documents at those stages, and are not necessary in a normal submission process. These stages, however, can be used for mirroring and tracking of final stage and published standards, which many authors do.

Example values:
PWI: 00
NMIP: 10
WD: 20
CD: 30
DIS: 40
FDIS:50
IS: 60

For Guide, possible stages are:
Preliminary stage (PWI): 00
Proposal stage (NP): 10
Preparatory stage (WD): 20
Committee stage (CD): 30
Publication stage (IS): 60
////


////
Comment 5: DOCUMENT SUBSTAGE (:docsubstage:)

Substage code for the document status. See International harmonized stage codes at: https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html

If this is left out, a substage of “00” is assumed, with the exception of stage “60” (published), where a substage of “60” is assumed. (“60.00” is the final proof, “60.60” the published document.)

For Guide, possible substages are:
Propose new project (PWI) / Proposal registered (NP) / Project registered (WD) / Committee draft registered (CD) / Final draft under publication (IS): 00
Proposal under review, ballot, or study (PWI,NP,WD,CD): 20
Proposal returned for changes (NP,CD): 92
Project deleted (PWI,NP,WD,CD): 98
Proceed with project (PWI,NP,WD,CD): 99
Close review/voting/comment period (PWI,NP,WD,CD) / Standard published (IS): 60
////

////
Comment 6: TECHNICAL COMMITTEE TYPE (:technical-committee-type:)

Type of the relevant technical committee. Defaults to TC if not supplied.

Values: TC, PC, JTC, JPC.
////


////
Comment 7: WORKGROUP TYPE (:workgroup-type:)

Example values: WG, JWG, JAG, AG (advisory group), AHG, SWG, SG, MA (maintenance agency), CORG, JCG, CAG

Default value: WG
////

////
Comment 8: ICS number (:library-ics:)

ICS (International Categorization for Standards) number for the standard.

There may be more than one ICS for a document; if so, they should be comma-delimited. (The ICS identifier is added to the document metadata, but may not be visible in the resulting document, depending on Metanorma flavor.)
